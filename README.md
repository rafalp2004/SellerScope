# Rating System for In-Game Item Sellers
## Project Overview

This project is an independent rating system for sellers of in-game items (CS:GO, FIFA, Dota, Team Fortress, etc.). It provides a transparent platform where ratings are based on user-submitted comments, which are thoroughly verified by trusted individuals. The resulting ratings form the basis for identifying the top sellers across various game categories.

## Key Features

- **Seller Profile Creation:** Sellers can register their profiles, which are reviewed and approved by an Administrator.
- **Comment Submission:** Anonymous users can leave comments on seller profiles. Comments are verified before publication.
- **Seller Rating Calculation:** Ratings are computed based on approved user comments.
- **Top Seller Rankings:** The system compiles lists of top sellers in different game categories.
- **Filtering:** Users can filter sellers by game and rating ranges.
- **Registration & Authorization:** Secure registration with email confirmation (24-hour expiry) and password reset functionalities.

## User Roles

- **Administrator:** Manages user registrations, comment verifications, and overall content moderation.
- **Seller:** Registers and manages their own profile, including password resets.
- **Anonymous User:** Views seller profiles and submits comments.
